Students who have passion for certain subjects may not undestand the vast variety of opurtunities available for them. A field like say ' Medicine '  has so many options which cater to different interests of students.
In future, I would like to further develop my program, with features that will help students to see a variety of options in their career as they pursue their favourite subjects. My aim is also to build upon this particular program by adding career oppurtunities- what to expect, how many years of practice required, what challenges are in store, the best way to achieve the goal- from a students perspective.
At present this is just a simple program, which I think is my stepping stone.
